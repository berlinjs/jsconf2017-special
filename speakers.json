    "description": "You've probably heard of the magic of a Service Worker when a user is offline, but what can we do for them when they get back online? We can take advantage of the Service Worker's life outside of the page and start to perform actions in the background.\n\nIn this talk we'll investigate the Background Sync API and the APIs that it depends upon, we'll look at what you might use it for and see it in action. Once that is behind us we can take a peek into the future and even more background tasks with a look at the Periodic Sync API."
