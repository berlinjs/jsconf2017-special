We can take advantage of the Service Worker's life outside of the page and start to perform actions in the background.\n\nIn this talk we'll investigate the Background Sync API and the APIs that it depends upon, we'll look at what you might use it for and see it in action. Once that is behind us we can take a peek into the future and even more background tasks with a look at the Periodic Sync API."

    "description": " If no one downloads or uses your npm module, you might need better documentation. Your README.md is the first access point for your code: I'll talk about how to use the standard-readme specification to make sure your readmes are high quality, and how the spec is already being used by hundreds of repositories to stop bike-shedding and save time. I'll demo a standard-readme generator and a linter, to help you write your readme. Ideally, you should be able to walk away knowing that writing docs is easier than you think."
